# DocLens

**DocLens** makes public documents readable.

DocLens provides AI-generated summaries of publicly available documents
without hosting, modifying, or redistributing the original files.

## How it works
1. You click a document link from this repository
2. The original PDF opens on the official website (e.g. DOJ)
3. If you have the DocLens browser extension installed, a summary appears automatically

## Why DocLens exists
Public records are often long, technical, and inaccessible.
DocLens adds fast context while preserving the original source.

## Documents
See the document index in the `documents/` folder.

## Disclaimer
Summaries are AI-generated and provided for informational purposes only.
Always refer to the original document for exact wording.
