# DocLens

DocLens is a catalog of public documents with concise, neutral summaries to help readers understand what a document covers before opening it.

## PDFs are not hosted
DocLens does not host, store, or redistribute PDFs. Every document entry links directly to an official public source.

## Browser extension behavior
When the DocLens browser extension is installed, it detects when you open a document from an official source and displays a summary overlay in your browser. The original document remains unchanged and continues to load from the publisher’s website.

## Disclaimer
Summaries are generated automatically for informational purposes and may contain errors or omissions. DocLens is not affiliated with document publishers, and summaries should not be treated as legal advice or a substitute for reading the original source.

## Documents
See the document index in `documents/index.md`.

For additional legal and attribution language, see `DISCLAIMER.md`.
